                                <h3>Superstar Couple with a Sustainable L.A. Farmhouse</h3>
                                <p>
                                    There’s surely some Beverly Hillbillies quip that pertains to the home that actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have built on a glorious hilltop site perched above the storied Los Angeles enclave. After all, the high-powered Hollywood transplants—he’s from Iowa; she was born in Ukraine—dug a well on the property to irrigate the land, planted (and harvested) a field of corn during the COVID lockdown, and dubbed the place KuKu Farms. But while Jed, Granny, and the rest of the Clampetts embraced a far more traditional take on Beverly Hills splendor—the sprawling French Neoclassical mansion pictured in the series credits was designed by architect Sumner Spaulding in the early 1930s and renovated by the legendary designer Henri Samuel in the 1980s—Kutcher and Kunis approached their passion project from a decidedly more modest perspective. 
                            </p>   
                                
                            <p>
                          
                        
                            “We wanted a home, not an estate,” Kunis insists, describing the six-acre property that now accommodates a main house connected to a guesthouse/entertainment barn, as well as a freestanding barbecue pavilion, all arrayed along a central axis elaborately plotted to capture the beguiling views from, between, and through the various structures. “We wanted the house to look like an old barn, something that had been here for decades, that was then converted into a house. But it also had to feel modern and relevant,” Kutcher elaborates. The design-obsessed duo launched their five-year adventure by assembling independent Pinterest boards to flesh out their personal visions for the project. “Building a house from the ground up is no small thing. This was either going to make us or break us,” Kunis says of the potentially divisive undertaking.

Now, Little Greene will release their latest paint range in January 2021... and, you guessed it, it's all built around a natural, earthy color palette. Packed with rusts, warm greens, deep reds and slubby browns, it's comforting, welcoming... and just what we need for 2021. And we love it.

                                  Pictures, vases, pillows and area rugs are all integral parts of a great decorating plan. Generally, they should support your theme, but allow more flexibility here; a unqiue wood frame could add wonderful variety to a contemporary room such as this photo displays. Accessories are located on walls, mantels, furniture, tabletops and floors; they can be paintings and photos or pillows.

                                 Currently for sale for $39.5 million, this home truly goes beyond expectations but doesn’t feel overwhelming. Regardless of its huge price tag and expansive size, this place feels like a real home thanks to the many warm textures and colors suggested by the interior designer. I hope you not only see this home as a “celebrity” home, but also as a home where a family that loves each other lived and made many beautiful memories inside.

                                   Gone are the days when only one finish would do and you could take a ‘matchy-matchy’ approach. Layer up your favourites for an eclectic, warm and textured scheme. Mix timber, celebrating the beauty of oak, olive wood, teak and ash or play with whitewashed stains. Layer natural sheepskin, woven rugs and thin knits with soft tan leather and raffia furnishings.

                                <p>
                                   This timeless trend epitomizes faded elegance and an unrefined sense of luxury. To create the feel of timeworn opulence from scratch try mixing new buys with vintage market finds. Look for decorative accessories such as chandeliers and mirrors that haven’t been perfectly restored, but have aged with character, and opt for furniture and textiles that feel lived-in.
