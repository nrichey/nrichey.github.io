      <h3>Welcome to Natalia's Cucina!</h3>
      <p>In 1988, Natalia Richey breathed life into the original Natalia's Cucina in Pismo Beach. What started as a Cal Poly senior project has since spawned a second restaurant, located in thriving downtown San Luis Obispo. Much beloved by locals and travelers alike, Natalia's was an early adopter of the farm-to-fork philosophy. 
      </p>
      <p>The owner's own Richey Farms produces the heirloom varietal vegetables and fruits found in Natalia's cuisine. Nestled on twelve acres of fertile Edna Valley soil, the working farm is a mecca of heirloom bounty. From figs to olives; San Marzano tomatoes, squash, Hachiya persimmons, Meyer lemons and five grape varietals that produce Natalia's own Richey Vineyards brand wines, the evidence of quality is never more apparent than at first bite, sip and scent!</p>
